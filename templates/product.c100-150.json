What Sets AWOL Vision’s ALR Cinematic Screen Apart from Others?<\/strong><\/p><p>The gain and contrast of the screen is a seesaw - high gain brings low contrast. AWOL Vision’s ALR  Cinematic Screen features TPU HBSP high-contrast material. This unique technology maintains high gain without compromising contrast, allowing us to deliver contrast levels up to 100 times greater than standard matte white projection screens.<\/p><p><strong>5.
