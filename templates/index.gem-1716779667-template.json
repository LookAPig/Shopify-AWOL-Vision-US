I'm a serious techie and very particular about my media entertainment, and the hype of this Ultra Short Throw speaks wonders when you turn it on the first time. I had put it to the test. 4K, 1080p, Gaming, and 3D, all resolutions are immeasurable in          quality. The colors are outrageous. The Fire Stick is a great bundle idea, definitely better than the built-in android on other projectors, and hidden away. The secret is choosing the best screen and gaining to bring out its true beast. I chose a gray 2.5 gain after my final determination from the math, and through all my prior research, which allows it to be watched easily during the day, just like a TV. The only slight difficulty is the time it takes to get it crisp and sharp while flushing it to the corners of the screen. So here's the homework done for you, just as great as the LTV-3500 in my opinion. Watch \"Mulan\" in 4K, it will speak for itself. AWOL is not popular as other brands, but it stands up better than the best brands out there.

I don‚Äôt like the traditional projector because it requires a lot of installation.

AWOL Vision 3500 draws my attention as it is a triple laser, 3500-lumen brightness, 150‚Äô‚Äô projection, HDR10+, and 3D. After searching around, I decided to try it out. I was surprised that how sharp, colorful, and bright the 3500 can make. The color is so vivid which makes me feel my Samsung TV is the black and white version. I can see every detail when I watch a 4K HDR movie on a 120‚Äô‚Äô screen. Every time I turned it on, I just don‚Äôt want to leave. My wife usually doesn‚Äôt show any interest in those techy items. But this time, she said she wanted to keep it and asked me do not to return it. Even further, she asked me to get a 150‚Äôscreen! As it is so bright, I don‚Äôt have to turn off the light and I can watch during the daytime. It is like a real  TV. Now I can enjoy watching the sports game with such a large screen and with the light on.

I could have gone with the LTV-2500 model because the room is completely dark, but I told myself let's just go with the best, so that is the reason we went with the 3500 model.<\/p>","button_text":"Learn More","button_link":"shopify:\/\/pages\/product-reviews"}}},"block_order":["58b0c890-8b69-407e-927f-d13c0064602e","a95137c0-af86-4203-a68d-5a5c50595b73","9dc67bef-1772-479d-aba2-0fe02341166e","da1f9bce-1285-472b-a29b-f9b081399813","6d270287-9746-4335-9c17-b32b2c81e8f2","85acfe9e-520d-43f0-9f7d-5bbdcf28d10c","949a7f60-b3aa-4222-9be5-9cff54ed35a2","5d7e8480-b628-4032-b523-eedb560be583"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"heading":"Customers Reviews","content":"<p>Open the AWOL Vision Instagram album to see how others are making movie memories with AWOL products.

The video quality is amazing!<\/h4>\n\n          <p>\n            In our theater room we had a 75-inch Sony TV, and it was very good, but we needed something bigger, so after\n            several months of studding the new Laser technology projectors I decided to go with the LTV-3500 from AWOL\n            and it was the best decision we made. Now we have 100-inch screen, and it looks amazing. The LTV-3500 colors\n            are so good. I could have gone with the LTV-2500 model because the room is completely dark, but I told my\n            self lets just go with the best, so that is the reason we went with the 3500 model.\n          <\/p>\n\n          <span><a href=\"https:\/\/awolvision.com\/pages\/reviews\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">Learn more<\/a><\/span>\n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div>\n      <div class=\"customer-review-slick-item\">\n        <div class=\"img-padding\">\n          <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0554\/7445\/4576\/files\/review-2.jpg?v=1685331971\" loading=\"lazy\">\n        <\/div>\n\n        <div class=\"text-content\">\n          <h5>G-Man<\/h5>\n\n          <h4>Take the next step in 4K, a true huge 4K<\/h4>\n\n          <p>\n            For starters let me say the AWOL LTV-2500 UST is the real deal. I'm a serious techie and very particular\n            about my media entertainment, and the hype of this Ultra Short Throw speaks wonders when you turn it on the\n            first time. I had put it to the test. 4K, 1080p, Gaming, and 3D, all resolutions are immeasurable in\n            quality. The colors are outrageous. The Fire Stick is a great bundle idea, definitely better than the\n            built-in android on other projectors, and hidden away. The secret is choosing the best screen and gaining to\n            bring out its true beast. I chose a gray 2.5 gain after my final determination from the math, and through\n            all my prior research, which allows it to be watched easily during the day, just like a TV. The only slight\n            difficulty is the time it takes to get it crisp and sharp while flushing it to the corners of the screen. So\n            here's the homework done for you, just as great as the LTV-3500 in my opinion. Watch \"Mulan\" in 4K, it will\n            speak for itself. AWOL is not popular as other brands, but it stands up better than the best brands out\n            there. Those who know will back me up on this.\n          <\/p>\n\n          <span><a href=\"https:\/\/awolvision.com\/pages\/reviews\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">Learn more<\/a><\/span>\n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div>\n      <div class=\"customer-review-slick-item\">\n        <div class=\"img-padding\">\n          <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0554\/7445\/4576\/files\/review-3.jpg?v=1685331971\" loading=\"lazy\">\n        <\/div>\n\n        <div class=\"text-content\">\n          <h5>Xiao Xi Qinqin<\/h5>\n\n          <h4>Best image quality and wife approved<\/h4>\n\n          <p>\n            I am a movie lover and I am always looking for a private home theater with a very large screen. I don‚Äôt like\n            the traditional projector because it requires a lot of installation. Ultra Short Throw projector can project\n            large screens in such a short distance without installation meets my requirements. AWOL Vision 3500 draws my\n            attention as it is a triple laser, 3500-lumen brightness, 150‚Äô‚Äô projection, HDR10+, and 3D. After searching\n            around, I decided to try it out.\n            <br>\n            I was surprised that how sharp, colorful, and bright the 3500 can make. The color is so vivid which makes me\n            feel my Samsung TV is the black and white version. I can see every detail when I watch a 4K HDR movie on a\n            120‚Äô‚Äô screen. Every time I turned it on, I just don‚Äôt want to leave. My wife usually doesn‚Äôt show any\n            interest in those techy items. But this time, she said she wanted to keep it and asked me do not to return\n            it. Even further, she asked me to get a 150‚Äôscreen!\n            <br>\n            As it is so bright, I don‚Äôt have to turn off the light and I can watch during the daytime. It is like a real\n            TV. Now I can enjoy watching the sports game with such a large screen and with the light on.\n            <br>\n            Overall, I‚Äôve really enjoyed watching shows and movies on my LTV-3500 and am super excited to see what other\n            products or updates they come out with! I highly recommend it!\n          <\/p>\n\n          <span><a href=\"https:\/\/awolvision.com\/pages\/reviews\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">Learn more<\/a><\/span>\n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div>\n      <div class=\"customer-review-slick-item\">\n        <div class=\"img-padding\">\n          <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0554\/7445\/4576\/files\/review-4.jpg?v=1685331971\" loading=\"lazy\">\n        <\/div>\n\n        <div class=\"text-content\">\n          <h5>Seung H.

AWOL vision UST\n            projector outputs a very crisp, vivid, great-quality video and works very well with ambient lights on. Its\n            picture quality is close to our LG OLED TV. If anybody is looking for a TV larger than 100\", this will be a\n            good option in many ways. It has built-in speakers and its sound quality is pretty good too. A combination\n            of AWOL UST and floor rise-up motorized screen make it portable so that I can bring them out to my backyard\n            for outdoor watching too.\n            <br>\n            We really enjoy this projector.

I do not have a dedicated theatre room so I needed a lot of light to take the place of my Sony 75 led.  Wonderful picture even in a fairly lit room.Great focus, great color, great contrast‚Ä¶right out of the box. I had one small question‚Ä¶they answered it right away. I did all the setup except installing the screen. I highly recommend this projector. Soon, they will have Dolby Vision and 3d‚Ä¶all downloaded to the projector. Can‚Äôt wait.

I'm a serious techie and very particular about my media entertainment, and the hype of this Ultra Short Throw speaks wonders when you turn it on the first time. I had put it to the test. 4K, 1080p, Gaming, and 3D, all resolutions are immeasurable in          quality. The colors are outrageous. The Fire Stick is a great bundle idea, definitely better than the built-in android on other projectors, and hidden away. The secret is choosing the best screen and gaining to bring out its true beast. I chose a gray 2.5 gain after my final determination from the math, and through all my prior research, which allows it to be watched easily during the day, just like a TV. The only slight difficulty is the time it takes to get it crisp and sharp while flushing it to the corners of the screen. So here's the homework done for you, just as great as the LTV-3500 in my opinion. Watch \"Mulan\" in 4K, it will speak for itself. AWOL is not popular as other brands, but it stands up better than the best brands out there. Those who know will back me up on this.<\/p>","button_text":"","button_link":"shopify:\/\/pages\/product-reviews"}},"eae549da-0d3f-452c-8935-ee07d5006a28":{"type":"item","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/review-3.jpg","name":"Xiao Xi Qinqin","title":"","content":"<p>I am a movie lover and I am always looking for a private home theater with a very large screen. I don‚Äôt like the traditional projector because it requires a lot of installation.

AWOL Vision 3500 draws my attention as it is a triple laser, 3500-lumen brightness, 150‚Äô‚Äô projection, HDR10+, and 3D. After searching around, I decided to try it out. I was surprised that how sharp, colorful, and bright the 3500 can make. The color is so vivid which makes me feel my Samsung TV is the black and white version. I can see every detail when I watch a 4K HDR movie on a 120‚Äô‚Äô screen. Every time I turned it on, I just don‚Äôt want to leave. My wife usually doesn‚Äôt show any interest in those techy items. But this time, she said she wanted to keep it and asked me do not to return it. Even further, she asked me to get a 150‚Äôscreen! As it is so bright, I don‚Äôt have to turn off the light and I can watch during the daytime. It is like a real  TV. Now I can enjoy watching the sports game with such a large screen and with the light on.
