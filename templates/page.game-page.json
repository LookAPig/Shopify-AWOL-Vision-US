Both lenses of the DLP-Link Active Shutter Glasses are supposed to close (i.e. go blank) when this flashed synchronization \"signal\" is displayed, so it is not actually seen by the viewer wearing the glasses. There is a light sensor on the 3D glasses and you have to make sure the sensor can receive the 120Hz rate white synchronization signal from the projection image. You have to turn on the glasses when you watch 3D movies each time – press the only button on the 3D glasses or select the left\/right setting in the 3D menu to change the left eye or the right eye as the main viewing eye depends on different users.<\/p>"}},"0964f6b4-ea55-4ee0-bd87-a4e319011445":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What is 24 FPS and why was it added?","answer":"<ul><li>Most movies are filmed at 24 frames per second (FPS).
